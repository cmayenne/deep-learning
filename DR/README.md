# Dimensionality Reduction

## Algorithms in Machine Learning, ISAE-SUPAERO

This repository contains course materials for my Machine Learning class on the topic of Dimensionality Reduction:
- <em>dimensionality_reduction_class.pdf</em> : course presentation with teaching content
- <em>dimensionality_reduction_class.ipynb</em> : Python notebook illustrating the course notions
- <em>dimensionality_reduction_class-empty.ipynb</em> : same Python notebook to follow with students during class


### Working with Google Colab

To follow the notebooks with Google Colab, simply go to:
https://github.com/SupaeroDataScience/
- For class follow-up: https://colab.research.google.com/github/SupaeroDataScience/deep-learning/blob/main/DR/dimensionality_reduction_class-empty.ipynb
- For completed notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/github/SupaeroDataScience/deep-learning/blob/main/DR/dimensionality_reduction_class.ipynb

Then click on "Copy to Drive" to be able to execute it and save your copy. The first section of the notebook is there to initialize the environment from Google Colab.

### Homework follow-up

After the session, you will have tried different ways to learn a representation for handwritten digits, from PCA, t-SNE up to simple and more complex Autoencoders. To continue work at home, we ask you to:
- Study the paper entitled "Representation Learning: A Review and New Perspectives", in the bibliography folder, to expand your view on the types of methods, and have a synthesis of the main stakes of this field.
- Study the paper entitled "Bootstrap Your Own Latent: A New Approach to Self-Supervised Learning", in the bibliography folder, to discover one new approach among the most recent perspectives, and implement it for the dataset used in class. What are the advantages and drawbacks that you observe compared to the methods we implemented in the class (PCA, t-SNE, Autoencoders) ?
